	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity: The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.Time complexity, efficient Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine<b> space complexity</b>. However, people frequently confuse <b>Space-complexity</b> with auxiliary space.</p>
